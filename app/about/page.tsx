                  I&apos;m ashish aka asheeshh on the web. I&apos;m a 19 y/o student belonging to the Homo Sapiens species, a brother, a son, a friend, a self taught web developer and programmer, an open source enthusiasist, an extreme melophile and I go by the bio - <span className="underline">best of the worst sides</span>.

                <p>
                  As my age already suggests, I&apos;m a high school graduate and an undergrad in college pursuing B.Tech (soon). I had already started programming back when I was in 11th standard as we had python in our school curriculum. I started web development one year later and I like working on the web a lot (mostly frontend). Oh, btw - I don&apos;t design my web apps ðŸ˜…. If you want to know about what programming languages I know, they are - typescript, python, go and a little bit of ruby and cplusplus.

                  I&apos;m also into technical writing and blogging. I write mostly on{" "}

                  Things I do other than dev and programming? Not much, but I do play football (touching grass is important). I also just like to go on the terrace with soft music and watch clouds pass by ðŸ˜Œ. I&apos;ve also started gaming recently (only{" "}

                  I don&apos;t talk much over any platform but I like making friends (be it online or irl though I&apos;m somewhat introverted!). So, in case you want to talk about anything, just hit me up and I&apos;ll get back to you once I&apos;m active/online. All my social links are listed{" "}
