              Sigh. Another year is coming to an end—just two more days left. 😔 It feels like I was writing my last "Now" page only yesterday. 2024 has been an incredibly intense year for me—a year of drastic change, loss, and transformation. 💔✨
            </p>
            <p>
              From December 2023 to December 2024, I went through moments that reshaped my life in ways I never anticipated. I lost many things—both personally and professionally. I lost people who were close to me, and in the process, I changed—everything about me did. The way I look, the way I think, the way I approach life—none of it is the same anymore. 🔄
            </p>

              This year will forever remain unforgettable for me, not because of accomplishments, but because of the sheer intensity it brought into my life. ⚡ There were things I couldn't achieve and plans that didn't work out as I had hoped. And if I'm being honest, I spent a lot of my time overthinking 🤯, daydreaming about the future ☁️, and researching things that, looking back, didn't really matter much to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also wasn't coding as consistently as I wanted to. 💻 You can even see that reflected in my GitHub contributions this year—it's a reminder of the highs and lows I've been through. 📉📈
            </p>
            <p>
              As 2024 comes to a close, I'm hoping to spend this final week being as productive as possible 🛠️ and making time for the people who matter—especially my family. ❤️
            </p>

              That's it from me for now. I'll see you in the new year! 🌟 Wishing you a very Happy New Year in advance if you're reading this before it, and a belated Happy New Year if you're reading it after. 🎉🥳
            </p>
            <p>
              Take care, and goodbye for now. 👋
